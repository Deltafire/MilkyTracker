Notes on building MilkyTracker for Amiga68k
==============================

./build_gmake to make the makefiles

Configuration
=============
To compile with ixemul.library in mind run:
make config=ixemul_m68k-amigaos	

To compile with libnix just run:
make

Dependencies
============

To build MilkyTracker you will need the following development libraries:

SDL	- http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/SDL-Amiga
libz	- http://aminet.net/package/dev/lib/zlib_68k
libjpeg	- http://aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libjpeg9_a68k

Note to package maintainers: MilkyTracker contains an internal copy of
libzzip that has been modified for use with MilkyTracker; An externally
linked libzzip will not work correctly (ZIP support will be broken).
